	<p>I still shed, shed the tears
And try to overcome the fears.
For time it tainted, poisoned me
But does you've crucified me again?

Lost in fiction, you'll find harmony
Switching diction, so no-one can say

And I might need another chance
All I've lost is confidence
Pick myself up off the ground
So I can find what can't be found</p>
